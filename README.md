# RBT-Dictionary
This program imitates basic functions of a dictionary using the red-black tree data structure. This code was developed with a group of 4 for a project in our CS-400 class at UW-Madison. My main contributions were in the backend mainly on the DicSearchBackendInterface.java, DicSearchBackendBD.java, and BackendDeveloperTests.java files.
